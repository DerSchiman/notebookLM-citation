# NotebookLM Citation Extension

This Chrome extension enhances Google NotebookLM by automatically mapping citation numbers to their source filenames and presenting the results in a convenient overlay.

## Features

- Expands hidden citation groups to reveal every source.
- Parses `aria-label` spans to pair citation numbers with document titles.
- Displays a draggable, minimizable legend with a copy-to-clipboard button.

## Usage

1. Load the extension in Chrome via `chrome://extensions`.
2. Open [notebooklm.google.com](https://notebooklm.google.com).
3. The legend appears automatically and updates as citations change.

**Status:** Experimental but functional for collecting citation mappings.
